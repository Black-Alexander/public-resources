# Gene Lists

This directory contains useful gene lists. Note that the repo with the
MacArthur lab gene lists is already a submodule in this repo, so I haven't
replicated those here.

## `2016_fuchsberger`

The gene lists that begin with `2016_fuchsberger` are from the
supplemental materials of 10.1038/nature18642. See Supplementary Table 32.

## `2014_purcell`

The gene lists that begin with `2014_purcell` are from Supplementary Table 2 of
10.1038/nature12975. These gene lists were enriched for rare disrupting coding
variation in schizophrenia cases. The `composite` list is the union of the
other four lists and was also enriched for rare disrupting coding variants.

## `solute_carriers.txt`

Genes in the solute carrier family downloaded from
[HGNC](https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/set/752) on 2017/12/18.
